# Introduction

In this workshop we will build an application that runs a game of bowling.  You may be familiar with the "bowling kata", which is often used to practice test-driven development.  Our application will do more than calculate scores: it must manage the progression of a game with multiple players, the display of information to the players, and the _pinsetter_ hardware that automatically sets up the pins before each player bowls.
