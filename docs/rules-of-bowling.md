## The rules of ten-pin bowling

A single game consists of 10 “frames”, with each frame consisting of two chances to knock down ten pins (with the exception of the last frame).

Each pin you knock down earns you a point, while you can also score extra points by hitting “strikes” or “spares”.

* Strike: When all ten pins are knocked down on the first roll (marked "X" on the scorescreen), the frame receives ten pins plus a bonus of pinfall on the next two rolls (not necessarily the next two frames). A strike in the tenth (final) frame receives two extra rolls for bonus pins.
* Spare: When a second roll of a frame is needed to knock down all ten pins (marked "/" on the scorescreen), the frame receives ten pins plus a bonus of pinfall in the next roll (not necessarily the next frame). A spare in the first two rolls in the tenth (final) frame receives a third roll for bonus pins.

The maximum score is 300, achieved by getting twelve strikes in a row within the same game (known as a perfect game).
