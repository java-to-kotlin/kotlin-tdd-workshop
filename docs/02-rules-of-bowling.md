# The rules of ten-pin bowling

Players take turns to roll a bowling ball down a wood or synthetic _lane_ toward ten _pins_ positioned evenly in four rows in an equilateral triangle.  A single game consists of ten _frames_ for each player, with each frame consisting of two chances to knock down ten pins (except for the last frame).  Most alleys allow a maximum of six or eight players on a lane at once.

One point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. When less than all ten pins are knocked down in two rolls in a frame (an _open frame_), the frame is scored with the total number of pins knocked down. However, when all ten pins are knocked down with either the first or second rolls of a frame (a _mark_), bonus pins are awarded as follows:

* _Strike_: When all ten pins are knocked down on the first roll (marked "X" on the scorecard), the frame receives ten pins plus a bonus of pinfall on the next two rolls (not necessarily the next two frames). A strike in the tenth (final) frame receives two extra rolls for bonus pins.
* _Spare_: When a second roll of a frame is needed to knock down all ten pins (marked "/" on the scorecard), the frame receives ten pins plus a bonus of pinfall in the next roll (not necessarily the next frame). A spare in the first two rolls in the tenth (final) frame receives a third roll for bonus pins.

The maximum score is 300, achieved by getting twelve strikes in a row within the same game (known as a _perfect game_).


# The scorecard

The scorecard is divided into 10 frames and each frame is divided into two boxes in which the individual score from each delivery is recorded. The cumulative score after each frame is written underneath, maybe as "9", "X", "/", or "–":

* If a player knocked down nine pins, they would score a “9”.
* A strike is recorded in the first box of the frame by an “X”.
* A spare is marked down on the scorecard with a “/”.
* A zero is recorded with a “-“.

In modern bowling alleys, the scoring is automatic and the scorecard is displayed on a computer monitor.
